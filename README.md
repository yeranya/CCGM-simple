More specifically, version 1.3.1.

This mod is a fork of CCGM.

## Disclaimer
From the original developer:
> I am a self-taught programmer who created this in my free time. There is a TON of room for updates and improvements. There is no guarantee that this software will work as intended. That said, please don't hesitate to send me your suggestions.

From me:
I am not a programmer, merely just a person who has a vague idea of how to somewhat modify something already existing and usually in a not good manner.

## Installation and Usage

All other dependencies can be installed via `install/install_requirements.bat`

[This](youtube.com/watch?v=WCrLDGtBdKM) YouTube video from the original developer has a good overview of setting the mod up (disregard the discord and mapmod parts though), and [this](youtube.com/watch?v=3dcfiiJNtyw) one covers some more options plus multiple crab game instances at the same time.
